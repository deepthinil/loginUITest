# Technical test Mobile SDET *(Android)*

## Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to do the CTM's Mobile SDET test. In CompareTheMarket we use native tools for writing our automated tests, in the case of *Android* we use `Espresso` and `UI Automator`. Our aim is to **automate as much as possible**, but in mobile, there is always a component of **manual exploratory** testing.

1. Install the app
2. Open the app
3. Find all error conditions during the sign in process and suggest improvement in this area (correct credentials, username: admin@ctm.com, password: password123)
4. By exploring the app find as many defects on both login gate and feedback screen (accessed by the three dots menu top right)
5. Using a format of your choice, write test cases for validation of the email/password fields
6. BONUS: Using an automation tool of your choice, write a single test validating a successful sign in
7. BONUS: Find the purpose of the Switch located on the Feedback screen
